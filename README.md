## About

The dihedral system is a drawing method that represents three-dimensional objects on a plane using two mutually perpendicular projection planes. 
As a student struggling with spatial visualization, I couldn't find adequate software to help me understand these projections - so I built my own! This tool provides:

- Interactive 3D visualization with guizmos and UI!
- Simultaneous dihedral projections (horizontal and vertical planes)
- Support for points, lines, and planes (for now)
- Web and desktop versions
- Save/Loading projects
- Documentation (ES): ![Github Wiki](https://github.com/aloyak/SistemaDiedrico/wiki)
